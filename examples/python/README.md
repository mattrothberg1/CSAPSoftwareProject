# Python Example

_Python example script showing proper use of the Cisco Sample Code header._

## Shebang Line

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
```

A "shebang" (`#!`) line, if used (only for executable Python scripts), should be the first line in the Python script and should reference the interpreter that will be used to execute the script.  This can also be a good way to indicate what Python version a file has been written to support.
  * `python` - Python v2 or v3
  * `python2` - Python v2
  * `python3` - Python v3

## Source File Encoding

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
```

The source file encoding declaration (if present), "must be placed into the source files either as first or second line in the file" ([PEP263](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/#defining-the-encoding)).

"Files using ASCII (in Python 2) or UTF-8 (in Python 3) should not have an encoding declaration" ([PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#source-file-encoding)).


## Module | Script Docstring

```python
"""Python Template for Cisco Sample Code.

Copyright (c) {{current_year}} Cisco and/or its affiliates.

This software is licensed to you under the terms of the Cisco Sample
Code License, Version 1.1 (the "License"). You may obtain a copy of the

```

The module or script docstring **must contain the Cisco copyright and license notice** and may also contain a useage message and/or other module-level documentation for your file (see [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#multi-line-docstrings)).


## Module | Script Metadata (aka. "Dunders")

```python
from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function

__author__ = "Zaphod Beeblebrox <zaphodbe@cisco.com>"
__contributors__ = [
    "Arthur Dent <arthurde@cisco.com>",
    "Ford Prefect <fordpref@cisco.com>",
    "Slartibartfast <slartiba@cisco.com>",
]
__copyright__ = "Copyright (c) <current year> Cisco and/or its affiliates."
__license__ = "Cisco Sample Code License, Version 1.1"
```

"Module level "dunders" (i.e. names with two leading and two trailing underscores) such as `__all__`, `__author__`, `__version__`, etc. should be placed after the module docstring but before any import statements except from `__future__` imports. Python mandates that future-imports must appear in the module before any other code except docstrings" ([PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#module-level-dunder-names)).
